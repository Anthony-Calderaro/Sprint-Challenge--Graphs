Describe the fixes you made to the Graph implementation here.

Dear Friend,

Below are my responses to your concerns. Please let me know if there's anything else I can help with.

1. The graph draws crazily.

2. All the vertexes are the same color.  They're supposed to match the color of the edges for each connected component.
3. My randomize button is broken.
4. It looks like part of the graph is getting cut off.
